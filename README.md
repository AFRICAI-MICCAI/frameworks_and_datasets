Materials for the AFRICAI 2023 summer school session on Open Access Frameworks and Datasets

# Processing
Given that we have our dataset ready and at hand and have our preprocessing and AI algorithm,
we nned a compute power to run the analysis. 
Eg-
Google collab: is a free notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud.

# Datasets
Public and free datasets in the medical field are quite limited. The following links are the best way to get
started.

Paper: https://medmnist.com/
Medical MNIST Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/medical-mnist

TCIA: The Canver Imaging Archive (tutorial notebook included)
